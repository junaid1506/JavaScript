- JavaScript main work is Action
- In Dom Manipulation we can chnge HTML, CSS and also perform actions
- With Js we can make Chrome extensions 
- Syntax isthe structure of words in asentence , For programming exact syntax must be followed
- Browser doing rendering means (html/css/js =download> Browser =rendring> Web page)
- Js fetch and sends info to server 
- Js runs at the client side in the browser 
- coffe script / TypeScript are transpiled(chnge) to JavaScript ( every new thing(typescript) is convert into the normal JS)
- code => (compiler) => executable
- code => (transpiler) => code
- (x)=>x + 1 => (transpiler) function(x){return x + 1; } 
- Modules(%) oprator to get remainder in inter=ger division 
- calculation is execute in BODMAS (Opreation start by left to right)
- Number in JS ( Integers , Floating(decimals) )
- Tips :- Avoid floating calculation 
- Use Math.round(0.1 + 0.2 ) ignore after point value for round figure 
- For dom always use querySelector()
- atribute like onclick ... here we can use java script in onclick function direct, onclick("here we can write js") , example =>onclick("alert("button is clicked")")
- All variable are has its own scope 
- Variable re difine in scope 
- var does not follow scope
- function in reusable code
- return statement end the function immediatly 
- In functions whem we write in (a,b) its call parameters and when we intilize it like (1,2) its called argument
- Group of multiple value together in key-value pairs is object
- When function is in object its call Method
- object can contain Primitive , objects (nested object) , functions
- When we write function in object its not need to write function name
- Automactic conversion of Primitive to objects
- objects work based on reference, not acual data
- Copying an object copies the reefernce, not the acual object.
- when comparirng with ==, you re comparirng refrence not contet 
- chnge to one reference affects all copies 
- De-structuring : Extract properties from objects 
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): Not the same as JS object, but similar
- Common use in network call and data storage
